# Customer-Segmentation

An e-commerce company has a variety of customers. Every customer has a different set of tastes
and interests and may belong to different financial levels. Therefore, it is a heavy challenge for the
marketing and strategy team to decide what products it should be promoting or what kind of
campaigns will lead to the most lucrative results.

Spending score is one such metric through which you can segregate customers. Spending score is
not just determined by the financial situation, but it is also based on other factors such as customer
behavior, the kind of products a customer buys, etc.

In this project, our team wants to identify the customers who will most easily converge and buy products.
In doing so, we will show the different segments in percentage and also predict the kinds of products and
Marketing campaigns that will be most effective with customers.
